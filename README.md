## Problem statement
MwangiKaranja Co. is a mid-sized e-commerce company that deals in the sale of the best footwear brands in the world: Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, New Balance, 
Reebok, Vans, Under Armour, etc. The marketing team feels like the landing home page needs a revamp to increase the conversion rates of customers visiting the website. 
The UI/UX team is tasked with a project to give the landing page an uplift. The page will have high quality 4K images of both pretty models and shoes.
The website is also expected to be super responsive to clicks with smooth animated transitions.
The baseline conversion rate is 13%. The new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%
